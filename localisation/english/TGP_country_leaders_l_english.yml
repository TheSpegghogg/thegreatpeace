POLITICS_FRANZ_FERDINAND_DESC:0 "After Franz Josef died in 1909, Franz Ferdinand was given the blessing of being able to realize what he had envisioned for his homeland. Instead of continuing the old Empire, he pursued his ambition and realized his views which he had always had: giving autonomy to the other ethnicities within the Empire. This made many Austrian nationalists outraged. When he formed the United States of Greater Austria, the same nationalistic Austrians demanded he abdicate. In response to that, he forced them out with the army, which was albeit controversial among the moderate citizens of the Empire. There is still resentment towards him, but he attempts to stop it while he is still in good health."
